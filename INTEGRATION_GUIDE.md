# Integration Guide: Property Listing DDD/CQRS into Rental Project

This document provides guidance on integrating the Property Listing DDD/CQRS implementation into the rental project.

## Overview
The Property Listing service has been built with:
- Domain-Driven Design (DDD) architecture
- Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern
- Clean layered architecture with proper separation of concerns
- Comprehensive testing suite
- Dependency injection for loose coupling

## Architecture Components

### Domain Layer
- Property entity with business rules and validations
- Domain services for business logic operations
- Abstract base classes defining contracts

### Application Layer
- Command handlers for write operations
- Query handlers for read operations
- DTOs for commands and queries

### Infrastructure Layer
- Repository pattern with abstract base class
- In-memory implementation
- Event publisher/subscriber system

### Endpoint Layer
- REST API controllers
- Integration with command/query handlers

## Integration Steps

1. Review the rental project's tech stack and architecture
2. Map the Property domain to the rental domain entities
3. Adapt the DDD patterns to the rental project's context
4. Integrate the CQRS patterns into the rental project's API
5. Connect to the rental project's data storage systems
6. Adapt the event system to the rental project's needs

## Files to Integrate
